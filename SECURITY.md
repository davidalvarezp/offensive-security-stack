# Security Policy

## Purpose

The Offensive Security Stack (OSS) is an **educational framework**.
It does **not contain real exploit code**, and it includes safeguards
to prevent misuse.

Security issues are treated seriously, especially if they:
- Enable real-world exploitation
- Bypass lab restrictions
- Allow execution outside controlled environments
