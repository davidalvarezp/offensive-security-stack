# Jitter Beacon Demonstration (Educational)

## Purpose

Explain how **jitter** modifies beacon timing and why defenders must account for it.

This is a **theoretical discussion only**.

---

## What Is Jitter?

Jitter introduces **randomized delays** into beacon intervals to:
- Reduce predictability
- Evade simple timing detection

---

## Conceptual Comparison

| Beacon Type | Timing |
|-----------|--------|
| Interval | Fixed |
| Jittered | Variable within a range |

---

## Defensive Challenges

- No exact periodicity
- Wider timing distribution
- Requires statistical detection

---

## Defensive Strategies

- Long-term behavior analysis
- Clustering of destination patterns
- Entropy analysis of intervals

---

## Educational Outcome

Students learn why **advanced detection relies on behavior**, not signatures.
