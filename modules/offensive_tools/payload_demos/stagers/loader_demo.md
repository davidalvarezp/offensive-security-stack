# Loader Demonstration (Educational)

## Purpose

Describe the role of loaders in **modular execution architectures**.

No memory techniques or evasion logic are included.

---

## What Is a Loader?

A loader:
- Prepares execution context
- Initializes components
- Controls execution flow

---

## Conceptual Characteristics

- Small initial footprint
- Delegates functionality
- Coordinates stages

---

## Defensive Observations

- Unusual process behavior
- Memory allocation patterns (high-level)
- Execution chaining

---

## Educational Outcome

Students learn how **execution flow analysis** helps detect complex threats.
