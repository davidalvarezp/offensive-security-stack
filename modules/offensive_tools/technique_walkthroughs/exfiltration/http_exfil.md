## Purpose
Describe how standard web traffic can be abused for data leakage.

## Concept Summary
HTTP exfiltration embeds data into:
- Requests
- Headers
- Payload structures

All within apparently normal traffic.

---

## Detection Challenges
- Traffic blends with legitimate use
- Encrypted channels obscure content
- Volume-based detection required

---

## Defensive Strategies
- Behavioral baselining
- Proxy inspection
- Data loss prevention (DLP)

---

## Educational Goal
Understand **why visibility matters more than protocol blocking**.
