# Buffer Overflow Demonstration (Educational)

## Purpose
Explain how memory corruption vulnerabilities occur at a high level.

No assembly, shellcode, or offsets are provided.

---

## What Is a Buffer Overflow?

A buffer overflow happens when:
- More data is written than allocated
- Memory boundaries are not enforced
- Adjacent memory is overwritten

---

## Conceptual Flow

1. Program allocates fixed buffer
2. Input exceeds buffer size
3. Memory corruption occurs
4. Program behavior becomes undefined

---

## Why This Is Dangerous

- Program crashes
- Logic corruption
- Potential control-flow manipulation

---

## Modern Mitigations

| Defense | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| ASLR | Randomize memory |
| NX | Prevent execution |
| Stack canaries | Detect corruption |
| Safe languages | Avoid raw memory |

---

## Educational Outcome

Understand **why memory safety matters**, not how to exploit it.
