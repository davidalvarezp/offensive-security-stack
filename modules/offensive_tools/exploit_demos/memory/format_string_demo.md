# Format String Vulnerability Demonstration (Educational)

## Purpose
Introduce unsafe string formatting concepts.

---

## Concept Summary

Format string vulnerabilities occur when:
- User input controls formatting
- Output functions interpret input as format instructions

---

## Conceptual Risk

- Memory disclosure
- Program crashes
- Unintended behavior

---

## Example (Abstract)

Unsafe:
- Program prints user input directly

Safe:
- Program explicitly defines formatting

---

## Defensive Controls

- Always define format strings
- Use safe APIs
- Enable compiler warnings

---

## Teaching Focus

Understanding **input trust boundaries**.
