# Password Attack Demonstration (Educational)

## Purpose
Illustrates common password attack strategies without executing them.

---

## Attack Categories (Conceptual)

- Guessing (human behavior based)
- Reuse exploitation
- Policy abuse
- Credential stuffing (theoretical)

---

## Why Passwords Fail

- Humans reuse passwords
- Complexity ≠ entropy
- Policies often encourage predictable patterns

---

## Example (Non-Executable)

User password pattern:
- Summer2024!
- Winter2024!

This illustrates **predictability**, not an attack method.

---

## Defensive Controls

- Passphrases
- Rate limiting
- MFA
- Password managers

---

## Teaching Objective

Understand **why passwords alone are insufficient**.
