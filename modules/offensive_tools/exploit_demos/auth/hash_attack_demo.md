# Hash Attack Demonstration (Educational)

## Purpose
This document explains how password hash attacks work at a **conceptual level**
to help students understand why strong hashing and salting are required.

No cracking tools or commands are included.

---

## Concept Overview

A hash attack attempts to recover plaintext passwords from hashed values by:
- Guessing possible passwords
- Hashing guesses
- Comparing results to stored hashes

This is possible when:
- Weak hashing algorithms are used
- No salts are applied
- Passwords are predictable

## Common Hash Weaknesses

| Weakness | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Unsalted hashes | Enables reuse across users |
| Fast algorithms | Enables brute force |
| Weak passwords | Enables dictionary attacks |

---

## Defensive Mapping

| Offensive Concept | Defensive Control |
|------------------|------------------|
| Hash guessing | Slow hashing (bcrypt, argon2) |
| Precomputation | Unique salts |
| Password reuse | MFA + password policies |

---

## Lab Discussion Questions

1. Why is SHA-1 unsuitable for password storage?
2. How does salting change the threat model?
3. Why do slow hashes matter more than long passwords?

## Ethics Reminder

This material is for **learning only**.
Do not attempt to recover real passwords.
