# ARP Poisoning Demonstration (Educational)

## Purpose
Explain how local network trust can be abused conceptually.

---

## What Is ARP?

ARP maps:
- IP addresses → MAC addresses
- Assumes devices are honest

---

## Conceptual Attack Flow

1. Attacker sends false ARP messages
2. Victim updates ARP table
3. Traffic is misdirected

---

## Why This Works

- No authentication
- Broadcast trust model
- Legacy protocol design

---

## Defensive Measures

- Static ARP entries
- ARP inspection
- Network segmentation

---

## Learning Objective

Understand **why LAN security matters**.
