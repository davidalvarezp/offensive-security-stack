# Man-in-the-Middle Demonstration (Educational)

## Purpose
Describe how interception attacks occur in theory.

---

## Concept Overview

A MITM attacker positions themselves:
- Between two communicating parties
- Without either side realizing

---

## Common Preconditions

- Weak encryption
- Untrusted networks
- Certificate validation failures

---

## Defensive Controls

- TLS everywhere
- Certificate pinning
- Secure Wi-Fi configurations

---

## Ethical Context

MITM concepts help explain:
- Why encryption matters
- Why warnings must not be ignored
