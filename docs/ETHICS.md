# Ethics & Responsible Use

## Educational Mission

The Offensive Security Stack (OSS) exists to:
- Teach offensive security concepts safely
- Improve defensive understanding
- Train blue teams, red teams, and educators

It is **not** a hacking tool.
It is a **learning platform**.

## Core Ethical Principles

1. **Authorization First**
   Only operate in environments you own or are authorized to use.

2. **Isolation Required**
   All activities must occur in:
   - Labs
   - Sandboxes
   - Virtualized or air-gapped networks

3. **No Harm**
   No real exploitation, service disruption, or data theft.

4. **Transparency**
   Students must understand *why* techniques exist, not just *how*.

5. **Defense-Oriented Thinking**
   Every offensive concept should map to:
   - Detection
   - Prevention
   - Mitigation

## What This Project Will Never Do

- Include real exploit payloads
- Automate real attacks
- Obfuscate malicious behavior
- Evade law enforcement
- Encourage illegal activity

---

## Educator Responsibility

Instructors using OSS must:
- Clearly explain ethical boundaries
- Enforce lab-only usage
- Emphasize legality and consent
- Provide defensive context

---

## Student Responsibility

Students must:
- Respect ethical constraints
- Ask before testing
- Report unsafe behavior
- Focus on learning, not breaking things

---

## Ethics Are Not Optional

Misuse of this framework violates:
- Project policy
- Academic integrity
- Professional standards

Use responsibly.
